## Task 1: Iris Flower Classification

Built a classification model to identify iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their petal and sepal measurements.  
The model was trained on sample data and tested for accuracy using machine learning techniques.

---

## Task 3: Car Price Prediction

Developed a regression model that predicts car prices based on features like fuel type, transmission, mileage, and seller type.  
Performed data preprocessing and trained the model to make accurate price estimations.

---

## Task 4: Email Spam Detection

Created a binary classification model to detect whether an email is spam or not.  
Cleaned the dataset and applied NLP techniques to classify emails using machine learning.

---

## Final Note

Each task helped me understand the core of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  
All tasks were executed in Google Colab and demo videos were uploaded to YouTube for reference.
